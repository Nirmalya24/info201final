##A visual representation of Child Mortality Rates by Countries (1751 - 2015)

Child Mortality has been a social issue that has been ever-present in the society. Simply defined, it is the *rate of deaths of children below 5 years of age*. Child mortality is dependent on a number of factors varying from parents' biological wellness to proper health care facilities being provided. As per data provided by UNICEF, child mortality rates around the world have been on a decline in the recent years. In 19th century central Europe,  specifically Germany, the child mortality rate was 1 in 2 births whereas in today's Germany the child mortality rate has significantly come down to 3.7 in 1000 live births. Even on a global scale, the child mortality rate has reduced to **3.7 million** from a massive **7.6 million** in the last 2 decades. A positive development on such a serious social issue has certainly not been highlighted publically by the media. It is largely due to the fact that the change on global level is a sedate process, but is it definitely something that's informative and can prove insightful in taking future steps. 

This shiny app has been created to primarily achieve the goal of extracting and portraying valuable information for NGO's and health organizations around the world working towards improving child mortality rates in different countries. Child Mortality rate data ranging from 1751 to 2015 has been intuitively depicted through this app which gives an idea of the current state of healthcare facilities andd could consequesntly help take better decisions regarding policies in the future. 


##Global Child Mortality

Our first visualisation depicts the magnitude of decline of Global Child Mortality Rate. It came down drastically from a **43% in 1800 to 4.3% in 2015**. 

##Child Mortality Rate by Country

The following visualisation is a depiction of child mortality rates in different countries through a time series plot. The visualization gives us an idea of difference in child mortality rates in developed couuntries and developing countries. The better healthcare facilities present in developed countries reflects through the better child mortality rates. We can also infer that other factors such as wars and epidemics had a significant effect on child mortality rates in countries that experienced them. 

##Child Mortality by Death Cause 

This visualization displays the global freqeuncy of child deaths and their causes in the form of an *area-filled* graph. The frequency of deaths are on the Y-axis whereas their respective causes are on the X-axis. This visualization uses multiple traces which means that is compares the cases with respect to two cases, i.e. 1990 and 2015
For example: The highest deaths recorded in **1990** due to **lower respiratory infection** were **2.12 million** deaths. Correspondingly, the number of deaths recorded due to the same cause in **2015** were **703.9K** deaths. 

We can clearly infer that the **child mortality rate was higher in 1990 than 2015**. Since the visulaization tells us that more than half of all(51.8% to be precise) children died due to infectious diseases, we can conclude that over the years there has been an improvement in the availability of vaccinations. 

##Child Mortality by Sex

This visualization represents the child mortality rate in the form of a line plot. One can select a country and view the child mortality rates of boys or girls or even compare the child mortality rates between genders and different countries. On the **Y-axis is the child mortality rate** and on the **X-axis is the year ranging from 1990 to 2010**. 

Looking at a fair number of instances, we can infer that in most countries, over the recent years, the **child mortality rates within boys has consistenty been greater than that of girls.**

##Fertility Rate Combined with Child Mortality

This visualization represents the total number of children a woman gave birth to that were victims of child mortality (died before the age of 5). One can view the contrast regarding different countries, i.e. the number of children lost by a woman in different countries over time. 

The slider allows the user to select the time period and the drop-down menu lets the user select the country. The line density plot then displays the comparison between the number of children that survived above the age of 5 (per woman) vs. the number children that did not survive above the age of 5 (per woman). The **Y-axis represents the frequency of children per woman** and the **X-axis represents the year span**.
Let us take the preset example of *Sweden*. The graph shows us that during the 1800-1900 period, on an average a **Swedish woman had more than 5** children and the mortality rates show that at an average **each woman lost at least 1 child**. Comparing it to the later period of 2000, on an average each **Swedish woman lost 0.005 children**.
